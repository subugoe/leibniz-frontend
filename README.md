## Running The App

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tools run.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

	```shell
	npm install
	```

	> **Note:** If install fails, make sure you have the latest NodeJS and npm installed. Also, it may help to delete node_modules first.

3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

	```shell
	npm install -g gulp
